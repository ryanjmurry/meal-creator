## Description

_This website help's users figure out a meal to create from their chosen ingredients_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _With the use of jQuery and Bootstrap CDN links, you shouldn't need to download another files outside of the repository. User should select what foods they have, beginning with what base they would like to use for the meal, and then selecting checkboxes for veggies, proteins, and dairy. After hitting the submit button, they are then provided with a recipe suggestion._

## Behavior Driven Development

-User selects 1 base: Rice, Pasta, Bread, Tortilla, Zoodle
-User then adds other ingredients from 3 other categories: Protein, Dairy, and Veggies
-On submit, a result is generated with a meal suggestion, based on the base selected.
